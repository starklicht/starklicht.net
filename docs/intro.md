## About the Project

Starklicht is a powerful and versatile lighting solution developed by creators Jannis and Tobi. Initially designed as a high-intensity lamp for a friend, the project evolved into a sophisticated, app-controlled lighting system. It gained traction among filmmakers üé¨ seeking affordable yet powerful equipment and was successfully used in various creative productions.

Following an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign, the project is transitioning to an open-source model. We believe the Lamp belongs to the Open Source Community! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Why Starklicht is Special ‚ú®

Starklicht is more than just another lighting project; it's a professional-grade, field-ready lighting controller designed for reliability and creative flexibility. It carves out a unique space between simple DIY projects and expensive, closed-ecosystem professional equipment.

Here‚Äôs what sets it apart:

### 1. Powerful and Intuitive Animation Engine üé®
At its core, Starklicht allows users to create complex, dynamic lighting scenes. Instead of just setting a static color, you can design multi-step animations with smooth, interpolated transitions between colors and brightness levels. This is perfect for replicating effects like a flickering fire, a slow sunrise, or pulsating energy fields, making it ideal for film and theater.

### 2. Hybrid Control: The Best of Both Worlds üéõÔ∏è
Starklicht offers a unique and highly effective hybrid control system:
*   **Remote Control via App:** A highly efficient, custom Bluetooth LE protocol allows for full control from a mobile application. The app provides a great user experience, making it easy to design and trigger complex animations.
*   **On-Device Tactile Control:** The lamp includes physical potentiometers for real-time, hands-on adjustments of color and brightness. This is invaluable for on-set situations where quick, precise changes are needed without reaching for a phone.
*   **Instant-Access Presets:** Four dedicated buttons allow users to save and instantly recall their favorite looks or animations, making it incredibly fast to switch between predefined scenes.

### 3. Designed for Professional, Battery-Powered Use üîã
The project was clearly designed for real-world production environments where power isn't always guaranteed:
*   **Industry-Standard Power:** Designed to be powered by **[V-mount batteries](https://youtu.be/zwAgzI9GIvo?si=fchEp6K2CtWoB1aQ)**, the standard for professional film equipment, ensuring seamless integration into existing gear workflows.
*   **Complete Power Management:** It actively monitors battery voltage and current consumption.
*   **Remaining Runtime Calculation:** The firmware calculates and displays the estimated remaining runtime, so you're never caught by surprise.
*   **Thermal Management:** With a dedicated fan control system, Starklicht can safely manage high-power LEDs without overheating, ensuring reliability during long shoots.
*   **Bowens Mount:** A 3D Printed, integrated [Bowens Mount](https://youtu.be/xdcqoKLByec?si=OuRkl3FwU5621zWE) allows you to connect Soft Boxes, Lenses and other adapters to the light! 

### 4. An Open, Accessible Alternative to Industry Giants üõ†Ô∏è
This is where Starklicht truly shines. While industry workhorses from companies like **ARRI** or **Aputure** offer incredible quality, their high cost and proprietary nature create a significant barrier to entry. Starklicht disrupts this model:
*   **Democratizing Professional Tools:** It delivers professional-grade features‚Äîcomplex animation, robust power management, and versatile control‚Äîat a fraction of the cost, making it accessible to indie filmmakers, students, and smaller studios.
*   **Total Customization & Repairability:** The combination of open-source firmware and a **fully 3D-printable housing** is a game-changer. You aren't locked into a manufacturer's design. You can modify the enclosure to fit a specific space, add custom mounts, or integrate different components. If a part breaks on set, you can print a replacement overnight, a level of field repairability that proprietary systems simply cannot offer.
*   **Limitless Extensibility:** You cannot add a new feature to a commercial lamp's firmware. With Starklicht, the possibilities are endless. You can code custom animation triggers, integrate new sensors, or adapt the light for unique creative challenges. This fosters innovation and allows the tool to be perfectly tailored to your vision.

In short, Starklicht fills the crucial gap between basic DIY projects and expensive professional gear, offering the best of both worlds: **pro-level features with complete user control, customizability, and accessibility.**

## Future Development üöÄ

The development of Starklicht is intended to be a continuous and community-driven process. Future improvements will be based on feedback and experiences from the user community, ensuring the product evolves to meet real-world needs.
