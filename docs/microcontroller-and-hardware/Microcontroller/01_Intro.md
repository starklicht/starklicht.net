## 🔍 A Few Important Notes

- **Economies of Scale**  
  Buying components and PCBs in bulk can *significantly reduce* the cost per unit.

- **Time Investment Not Included**  
  This estimate does **not** account for the time spent sourcing, soldering, or assembling. Expect a hands-on, rewarding process!

- **Component Flexibility**  
  This is an open-source project. You’re free to substitute parts depending on what you have or prefer—which can impact final costs.

## ✉️ Messaging Protocol

### Design Philosophy

The Starklicht BLE protocol is designed for maximum efficiency and simplicity, tailored for the constraints of Bluetooth Low Energy and embedded microcontrollers.

*   **Lightweight:** We use a raw binary format instead of text (like JSON). This makes messages extremely compact, ensuring most commands fit within a single 20-byte BLE packet to reduce latency and power consumption.
*   **Fast to Parse:** The fixed `[ID][DATA]` structure allows the device's firmware to read values directly from memory offsets without needing a complex parser, saving precious CPU cycles and RAM.
*   **Embedded-Friendly:** The protocol uses integer math where possible to avoid computationally expensive floating-point operations on the microcontroller.

This protocol is a living document. We are open to suggestions and changes to improve its functionality and performance.

- CMake or Make (optional, for advanced builds)

### Setup

❗️ This setup works, but is not optimal yet. If you have any Ideas, don't hesitate to add a PR!

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/starklicht-stm32.git
   ```
2. Open STM32CubeIDE
3. Select `File` → `New` → `STM32 Project From Existing STM32CubeMX Configuration File`
4. A new Popup with Project Creation Wizard appears
5. `File`: `Browse` → Select the `.ioc` File of this Repository
6. Set Targeted Language to `C++`
7. Click `Finish`
8. Replace `Inc`, `Src` and `Startup` in `Core` with the ones from this Repo
9. Replace `STM32F401CCUX_FLASH.ld` with the one from the Repo

Now you can Build the Project

### Building and Flashing

1. Build the project in STM32CubeIDE.
