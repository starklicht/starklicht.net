# Building and Flashing

If you did no

1. Build the project in STM32CubeIDE or download the newest [Release](https://github.com/starklicht/starklicht-stm32/releases)
2. Connect the STM32F410RB board via USB to UART.
3. Use STM32CubeProgrammer to flash the firmware onto the MCU. You need to transfer the `.elf` file.
